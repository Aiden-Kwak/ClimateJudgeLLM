            "Question": "Expert opinion: What do leading climate scientists say about the claim that global warming is not progressing as predicted?",
            "Response": "Based on the provided Knowledge, leading climate scientists, as referenced in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, confirm that climate change is progressing and already affecting people and ecosystems. The report is based on the assessment of around 6,000 peer-reviewed publications, most of which were published in recent years. This indicates that the scientific consensus supports the reality of global warming and its impacts, contradicting claims that it is not progressing as predicted. \n\nAs stated by Secretary-General Guterres, \"Climate change is moving faster than we are,\" emphasizing the urgency of addressing the issue based on scientific evidence.",
